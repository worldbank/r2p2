# Guidelines for Documenting and Styling Analytical Notebooks
This section provides best practices for structuring analytical notebooks to enhance readability. The guidelines include recommendations for hiding code cells to maintain a clean appearance in Jupyter Book, incorporating references where relevant, and organizing content logically to ensure clarity for readers.

- **Structure**. In all the Data Lab projects, please follow [this analytics structure](https://github.com/worldbank/sudan-poverty-monitoring/blob/main/docs/2-analytics.md).
- **Editing _toc.yml** 
- **Removing/hiding cell blocks** All notebooks will be rendered in Jupyter Book. To enhance readability, ensure code cells are hidden or removed using cell tags. In some cases, you may use the hide-input cell tag.
