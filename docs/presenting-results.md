# Presenting and Communicating Data Outputs
This section provides guidance on effectively preparing and sharing data results with clients, many of whom may not have a background on the data, variables and methods you have used in the analysis. The aim is to help team members present insights in a clear, accessible, and impactful way, ensuring that complex findings are communicated without unnecessary technical jargon.

## Notebook Content Guidelines
In the [notebook guidelines](/docs/notebooks-workflows.md), we mentioned that we adhere to a structure which provides details about the dataset being used and other methodological details. However, in each section of the analysis, also ensure that you clearly define which variables are being used from the data, whats the unit of analysis and so on.

## Explanations for Visuals and Tables
In the notebook, add brief narratives or observations for each table and figure. When presenting, be sure to explain key insights, trends, or notable absences in the figures and tables.

## Preparing for and Addressing Questions
Most of our clients are World Bank Task Team Leaders (TTLs) who are typically economists with Master’s or PhD-level expertise. While they may not be familiar with every dataset or method you’ve used, they are well-versed in rigorous statistical analysis and expect us to apply statistically sound methodologies. It’s essential, therefore, to keep this in mind and anticipate the kinds of questions they may ask.
